Among Us[d] is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. It was released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms. The game was also ported for the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and has planned releases for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing, and since the release of its first map, The Skeld, three other maps were added, those being MIRA HQ, Polus and The Airship. The Airship's design is based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, another video game series developed by Innersloth. A fifth map is currently in development and will be released in a future update.
The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.[e] The goal of the Crewmates are to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are ejected or all tasks are completed, whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.
While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been credited to the growth of the game. The game received positive reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay and setting, although it was criticized for its technical issues. In response to the game's popularity, Among Us 2 was announced in August 2020. However, the planned sequel was canceled a month later, and the team shifted its focus to improving the original game. Merchandise based on the game, such as toys, shirts, etc., were announced and released. Among Us has also inspired internet memes and achieved a very large following online.

<p>Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia,[2][32] and science fiction horror film The Thing.[33] The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us, but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".
Development began in November 2017.[34] The game was initially intended to be a mobile-only local multiplayer game with a single map.[35] Bromander paused development on Innersloth's other game, The Henry Stickmin Collection, in order to build Among Us' first map, The Skeld.[36] When they began developing the first map, they intended that the ship was always in crisis and that the Impostors could do tasks. However, they found this setup "stressful" and decided that it "[wouldn't leave] much time for detective work and informed meeting conversations".[33][34] Willard described playtesting as painful and frustrating, as the game would break down during sessions forcing him to send playtesters new builds off of Google Play. The team tested the game with 8 of their friends and never tested the game with 9 or the maximum of 10 players.[36] The game was developed using the Unity engine.[37]
The game was released in June 2018 to Android and iOS under the AppID of "spacemafia".[2][38] Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.[27] Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing".[35] The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",[39] adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.[39] The game was released on Steam on November 16, 2018.[35][40] Cross-platform play was supported upon release of the Steam version.[41][42] Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting,[g] and Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game's Steam release.[36]
On August 8, 2019, Innersloth released a second map, MIRA HQ,[43][44] a "tightly packed headquarters roughly the size of The Skeld." A third map, Polus, was added on November 12, 2019 and is set in a research station.[43][45] The fourth map, the Airship, was released on March 31, 2021 and is based on a location in the Henry Stickmin universe.[11][12] MIRA HQ and Polus originally cost players US$4 via in-app purchase. Their prices were reduced to US$2 on January 6, 2020, then made free on June 11, 2020.[46] While the map packs are still available for purchase on all platforms, they now only provide the player the skins that were bundled with the maps.
According to programmer Forest Willard, the team "stuck with [the game] a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint", putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week. This led to a steady increase in players, causing the game's player base to snowball. Bromander attributed this to the studio having enough savings to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well.</p>
